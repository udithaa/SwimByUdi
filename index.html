  <h1>The Swimming</h1>
  <p>Swimming is an ancient aquatic sport. It is the art of self-movement <br>in water by using hands and/or feet. Swimming is observed as a sport <br> or a recreational activity. Its main uses include lowering the body heat,<br> relaxation, exercise as well as athletic training. Swimming done in spare <br> time is a good way to relax. As the density of the human body is similar to <br> that of water, bones and joins do not receive much stress. Swimming can be <br> very effective for those patients suffering from disabilities.</p>
